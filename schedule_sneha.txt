1. Talk to the client and gather initial data  (4-5hrs)
	Get data from the client
		Speak to the client and get the data.
	Refine the specs
		Refine the initial specs if the client wants to add anything.
	Understanding the data
		Understand the data to see what the attributes are and how they are related.

2. Pre-processing 
	Figure out the tools and algorithms needed (2-3hrs)
		Look at the preprocessed data and figure out the tools and algorithms to be used for the visualization.

3. Initial UI design
	Initial sketch of the viz (1hr)
		Draw out a sketch on paper of how the UI for the visualization should look like.
	Exploring the libraries required (1-2hrs)
		Explore the data and figure out what libraries are needed for the visualization.
	Integrating the data with the viz (5-6hrs)
		Integrate the data with the UI and make the visualization work.

4.Testing (5-6hrs)
	Test the visualization
		Test the visualization to see if everything is working as expected, if not raise bugs
	Continuous refinement
		Refine the visualization to meet all the user requirements
	Work on bugs if any
		Fix any bugs that might have been raised

5. Feedback from client about further requirements 
	Feedback from client after the initial prototype (30 mins)
		Show the initial prototype to the clients and get their feedback
	Final feedback before the alpha release â€“ Functional demo with the actual data (1hr)
		Demo the final visualization to the client and get their feedback and do any changes required.
